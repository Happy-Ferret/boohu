	`“Below and above, left or right,
there's no way to flee, there's no way to hide,
no hope, no rest, no friend, no might,
my eyes are hurting, life is no lie.”

[Diary of Kaashtriman Deez Meir]
`,
	`“This is the place where I come from,
this is my dark kingdom,
here I abide, far from the night,
far from the light, far from the sky.
And there I'll die.
I won't retire.”

[Fragment of the Ballad of the Dark Orc]
`,
	`“Cold… So cold… There's something wrong in here. I can tell there were saijits living in this place. But now… there are nothing but monsters. Monsters everywhere! And fear is so cold. So cold…!”

[Blood-stained piece of paper, Anonym]
`,
	`“If flowers are gone,
I'll seed them again,
If darkness has won
I'll fight it again.”

[Poem signed Wergal]
`,
	`“‘Now, now’, the doctor said shakingly. ‘I won't let you die this early, good warrior. Know why? Because, if you die right now, we'll die together’.

No one answered.”

[Fragment of the Tales of the horrific maid, by Kow Yhers]
`,
	`“I don't mind if you die
I don't mind if I die,
it's so boring to die
when you don't give a damn.”

[Fragment of the Foul-mouthed Fool's Tricky Poems]
`,
	`“I am the son of Joy and Hope,
I've lost them both,
I'm orphan now.”

[Piece of yellow paper, Anonym]
`,
	`“I love her smile, her eyes, her soul,
I love her cheerful mind and might,
I will protect her with my life,
she will be freed, I will stand last.”

[Fragment of a message signed Knight Firo of Ombay]
`,
	`“[…] When I saw him, the child laughed. He stuck out his tongue, cheerfully ran away, and passed through a hole in the wall like a mouse. A milfid was coming, so I followed him, but then, when I searched for him, he was not here. Maybe he was just an illusion… but he saved my life.”

[Fragment of the Scientist's diary]
`,
	`“For this beam of peace I saw once in my life
I will hold my promise and cling to my last days,
I will raise this old knife, and then… come what may.”

[Fragment of Hope springs eternal, by Mowsh Rasadekarda]
`,
	`“Someone told me once these words:
whenever I cross your path,
something unexpected comes.
I couldn't refrain a smile.”

[Very old piece of paper signed Marevor Helith]
`,
	`“Here I am, I, Marevor Helith the nakrus, the former necromancer, roaming, surrounded by the shadows that had seen me changing into a living dead so long ago. I'm happy. I don't hate monsters. They were the only living creatures that could see me without cringing in a long, long time. Their presence soothed me during my transformation and my early dead life. I even enjoy them being there during my random walks through those corridors, in this lovely peaceful dungeon. Yacks, nixes, nadres, vampires… To all of you, guys, I'll be always grateful!”

[White paper signed Marevor Helith]
`,
	`“If you want to revive
don't be hasty,
there's a way to thrive,
but the method, my dear,
is so, so nasty.”

[Fragment of Beware of eternal life, by Marevor Helith]
`,
	`“I love life, I love hope,
y'all up there, listen up!
I won't ever give up.
If I'm lying down there,
don't be fooled,
I'm just taking a break.”

[Fragment of Red-Snake Naran's Diary]
`,
	`“La malbono grandas en la mallumo, sed la espero pli grandas en la koroj.”

[Piece of paper signed La Esperantisto]
`,
	`“Ho, ve, monstro terura! Vi ne povas vidi min, ne rigardu, ne plu revenu, ne plu revenu, ne plu revenu…”

[Piece of paper signed La Sciuro]
`,
	`“Bless the shadows, curse the lights,
don't be hasty, all's alright,
you can save yourself tomorrow
as long as you do not die.”

[Green piece of paper, seems to be a piece of advice for someone]
`,
	`Graved on the floor, in blood, you can see some letters that say:

“Beware, you mortal, you'll be next.”
`,
	`“It was so beautiful! All over the place, in Kaendra valley, flowers were blooming, red, blue, white and yellow. The breeze was tousling my hair like a gentle god. My cat, on the threshold, was meowing. My children were running down the hill. And then, everything was gone. I just can't believe it was a dream. I wanted so much to be back home and be far from this damned dungeon… I know that, if I keep fighting, I'll die for sure. From now on, I will hide. And I will get out of here from sure. Home is waiting for me.”

[A long page written in a rather hurried way. It is accompanied by the drawings of two children, most likely the author's]
`,
	`“Damned, damned kerejats! If it wasn't because of the light of these butterflies, they wouldn't have seen me. Luckily I'm small and I got in a barrel. But it was close. For Karihesat's sake, I hate those butterflies…”

[Piece of paper signed: The Hobbit Who Doesn't Want To Die]
`,
	`“I found a magara of noise! I'm so happy. I don't know how to use it, but anyway, I'm happy.”

[Blue piece of paper]
`,
	`“I was sent here to do something very urgent. That's why I was given so much help, my Elders told me to be cautious and not to use my sword if I could avoid it. I felt honoured and proud when I left. The only thing is… after I fell off the stairs, I don't remember a thing of what I'm supposed to do. After so many days… guess I'd be better off not coming back.”

[Notes signed: He who doesn't remember got to be a dungeon ward]
`,
	`“Earth is warm and sun is bright,
I will never lose your sight.
Even deep in the Undergrounds,
I will have you in my heart,
deep down in my sunny past.”

[Slightly burned piece of paper signed: The Wizard who can't resign]
`,
	`“Come on, move and make my day.
Just try! Take my life away.
You will be doomed anyway.
Those monsters who went astray
never crossed my path again.”

[Text engraved in the stone floor with fierceness, signed: the Frightening One]
`,
	`“Ha! Dear, dear, big evil yack! Running, I passed through the hole. And you crashed into the wall. You made me laugh so hard I thought I would die.”

[Piece of paper signed: Marvarelia, the Little Dark Elf]
`,
	`“There was a loud sound somewhere in the dungeon… A hound? A dragon? Whatever. I don't want to know.”

[Piece of thick paper, anonym]
`,
	`“Someone told me that was a good place to find bananas. I thought he was joking. But now that I'm here, I know he wasn't. The Undergrounds banana trees are so rare! They don't seem to even need a source of moonstone light. That's my chance to shine! I'll keep studying them as much as I can.”

[The rest of the paper is full of signs you don't understand. It's not Abrianese. You sigh: those saijits really make things complicated…]
`,
	`“No rival for me to kill
that's some kind of an ordeal,
no one's life for me to steal
please, come back, and pay the bill.”

[Fragment of a poem entitled The Greedy Raven, the rest of the letters have faded]
`,
	`“If you want to live on, run away and go home,
if you want to say hello, it's this way, come on, come…”

[The message is carved in stone. You think: yeah, hello… And you nervously look for a barrel]
`,
	`“Just a bit earlier, I climbed a tree to see a little farther. There was a kerejat butterfly shining in the distance. However, a milfid happened to see me and attacked me… Though I'm a gawalt, I ran away as fast as an arrow.”

[You blink at the paper, surprised. A gawalt? A gawalt monkey like you wrote that? Then, you smile: I will, too, run like an arrow!]
`,
	`“Rather than being smashed and eaten,
gather your will, stop to think.
You won't have your legend written
but you'll still be able to drink.”

[Fragment of the poem The Mouse And The Dragon, by Dak Limisur]
`,
	`“All my childhood, I kept complaining: I'm not a coward! Now I understand that cowardice may be a blessing.”

[Rafiluna the Goblin Coward]
`,
	`“I wonder why monsters exist. I wonder why we, saijits, exist. Why are we eating each other? What for have we been created? Are we even real?”

[The page is rather long… Snorting, you stop reading. Crazy saijits, that's too much]

here I abide, far from the night,
far from the light, far from the sky.
And there I'll die.
I won't retire.”

[Fragment of the Ballad of the Dark Orc]

If darkness has won

	`“[…] When I saw him, the child laughed. He stuck out his tongue, cheerfully ran away, and passed through a hole in the wall like a mouse. A milfid was coming, so I followed him, but then, when I searched for him, he was not here. Maybe he was just an illusion… but he saved my life.”

[Fragment of the Scientist's diary]

[Very old piece of paper signed Marevor Helith]
`,
	`“Here I am, I, Marevor Helith the nakrus, the former necromancer, roaming, surrounded by the shadows that had seen me changing into a living dead so long ago. I'm happy. I don't hate monsters. They were the only living creatures that could see me without cringing in a long, long time. Their presence soothed me during my transformation and my early dead life. I even enjoy them being there during my random walks through those corridors, in this lovely peaceful dungeon. Yacks, nixes, nadres, vampires… To all of you, guys, I'll be always grateful!”

[White paper signed Marevor Helith]

`,
	`“It was so beautiful! All over the place, in Kaendra valley, flowers were blooming, red, blue, white and yellow. The breeze was stroking my head like a gentle god. My cat, on the threshold, was meowing. My children were running down the hill. And then, everything was gone. I just can't believe it was a dream. I wanted so much to be back home and be far from this damned dungeon… I know that, if I keep fighting, I'll die for sure. From now on, I will hide. And I will get out of here from sure. Home is waiting for me.”

[A long page written in a rather hurried way. It is accompanied by the drawings of two children, most likely the author's]
`,

[Piece of paper signed: The Hobbit Who Doesn't Want To Die]
`,
	`“I found a magara of noise! I'm so happy. I don't know how to use it, but anyway, I'm happy.”

[Blue piece of paper]
`,
	`“I was sent here to do something very urgent. That's why I was given so much help, my Elders told me to be cautious and not to use my sword if I can avoid it. I felt honoured and proud when I left. The only thing is… after I fell off the stairs, I don't remember a thing of what I'm supposed to do. After so many days… guess I'd be better off not coming back.”

[Notes signed: He who don't remember got to be a dungeon ward]

Even deep in the Undergrounds,
I will have you in my heart,
deep down in my sunny past.”

	`“Come on, move and make my day.
Just try! Take my life away.
You will be doomed anyway.
Those monsters who went astray
never crossed my path again.”
